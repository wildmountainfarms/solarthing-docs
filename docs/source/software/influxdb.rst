Install InfluxDB
==================

Although CouchDB is the recomemnded database for SolarThing, InfluxDB can also be used.

.. note:: SolarThing treats InfluxDB 1.X installations different than InfluxDB 2.X installations

InfluxDB 2.X is recommended and more up to date than 1.X versions. You can install it here: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/install/

If you have to use InfluxDB 1.X for some reason, you can learn about it here: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/introduction/download/

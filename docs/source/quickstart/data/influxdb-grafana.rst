InfluxDB and Grafana
======================

If you have an InfluxDB 1.X installation or an InfluxDB 2.X installation, you can use the InfluxDB datasource to query data.

There is no documentation for the possible queries you can have. If you chose to use InfluxDB, you should be able to craft the queries yourself.

SolarThing Server
==================

SolarThing Server is a program to expose your CouchDB database as a GraphQL endpoint and as a web interface.

The exposed GraphQL database can be used by
`Wild GraphQL Data Source <https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/retrodaredevil-wildgraphql-datasource/>`_
and a `Grafana <https://grafana.com/>`_ server.
Note that using Grafana is not required, but is the best way for you to view your data.

SolarThing Server
==================

SolarThing Server is a program to expose your CouchDB database as a GraphQL endpoint and as a web interface.
The exposed GraphQL database can be used by `fifemon/graphql-datasource <https://github.com/fifemon/graphql-datasource>`_
and a `Grafana <https://grafana.com/>`_ server.

Setup for Other OS
=======================

The recommended way to setup SolarThing is to use a DietPi install (described in :doc:`dietpi`).
This page will help you get your system ready for a SolarThing installation if you are not using DietPi.

Gaining Remote Access
--------------------------

You should obtain SSH access to your system.
If you need more detailed steps, you may find them in :ref:`dietpi-gain-remote-access`.


Install Docker
----------------

Once you have access to your system, you should install docker on it.
You will need to install Docker Engine on your system, which should also install docker compose for you.

Rover RS485 Port
================

So you have a Rover (or supported device) with an RS485 port?

Unlike the :doc:`rs232-port`, Renogy still makes cables for the RS485 port. If you do not have a cable, you can
buy it here: https://www.renogy.com/rs485-to-usb-serial-cable/

Although this uses RS485 communication, no additional drivers need to be installed on a Raspberry Pi to get this working.

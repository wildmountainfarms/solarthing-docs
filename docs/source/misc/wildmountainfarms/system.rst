Our System
===========

This page contains informal documentation of what our system consists of.

Devices
---------

* 1:FX 2:FX 3:MX 4:MX
* Renogy Rover PG 40A
* EPEver Tracer 20A

Inverters
------------
Both FX's are 3400 watts each

Panels
-------

* 2310 Watts across 14 panels (14 165 Watt panels)

  * Angle varies throughout the year as it is adjusted when necessary

* 8 panels (4s2p) 75W each for 600W

  * Realistically I'd say this is probably 350W because of how old these panels are
  * Angle is 47 degrees from horizontal. Note these panels are also tilted maybe 10-20 degrees
  * Siemens SP75

    * 4.8A Short Circuit, 4.4A rated
    * 21.7V Open Circuit, 17V rated

* 2 panels (2s) 305W each for 610W

  * Angle is 47 degrees from horizontal (note front panel is actually 45 degrees). Note these panels are also tilted maybe 10-20 degrees
  * QCELLS - `Q.PEAK-G4.1 <https://www.q-cells.us/en/main/products/solar_panels/residential/residential03.html>`_ 305

    * 9.84A short circuit, 9.35A rated
    * 40.05V open circuit, 32.62V rated
